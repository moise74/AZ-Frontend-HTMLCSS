  <h1>My Webpage</h1>
  <p>My name is Moses Habimana , I am faster learner and hardworker in anything I DO. 
    I am  a student and I am very interested in tech fields because I like tech industry  expecially coding.
    I am doing front end development online to sharpen my skills and achieve my goals of becoming software engineer.
    The journey started when I joined Azubi Africa to help in achieving my goals.
    I will try my best to become a real software engineer the society need to solve their problems
    and make life easy.

      <h1>History of Internet</h1>
      <p>The Internet started in the 1960s as a way for government researchers to share information. Computers in the '60s were large and immobile and in order to make use of information stored in any one computer, one had to either travel to the site of the computer or have magnetic computer tapes sent through the conventional postal system.

        Another catalyst in the formation of the Internet was the heating up of the Cold War. The Soviet Union's launch of the Sputnik satellite spurred the U.S. Defense Department to consider ways information could still be disseminated even after a nuclear attack. This eventually led to the formation of the ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network), the network that ultimately evolved into what we now know as the Internet. ARPANET was a great success but membership was limited to certain academic and research organizations who had contracts with the Defense Department. In response to this, other networks were created to provide information sharing.
        
        January 1, 1983 is considered the official birthday of the Internet. Prior to this, the various computer networks did not have a standard way to communicate with each other. A new communications protocol was established called Transfer Control Protocol/Internetwork Protocol (TCP/IP). This allowed different kinds of computers on different networks to "talk" to each other. ARPANET and the Defense Data Network officially changed to the TCP/IP standard on January 1, 1983, hence the birth of the Internet. All networks could now be connected by a universal language.

      <h1 id="computer">HISTORY OF COMPUTER</h1>
      <P>The history of computers goes back over 200 years. At first theorized by mathematicians and entrepreneurs, during the 19th century mechanical calculating machines were designed and built to solve the increasingly complex number-crunching challenges. The advancement of technology enabled ever more-complex computers by the early 20th century, and computers became larger and more powerful.

        Today, computers are almost unrecognizable from designs of the 19th century, such as Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine â€” or even from the huge computers of the 20th century that occupied whole rooms, such as the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator.
